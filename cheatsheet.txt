PIC : Programmable Interrupt Controller


Keyboard on I/O ports 0x60 and 0x64. 0x60 is the data, 0x64 is the status

PIC has offset value stored during init, adds that number to the interrupt line to form the Interrupt Number.
Processor then looks up an IDT(Interrupt Descripter Table) to find the input handler address corrosponding to 
the interrupt number.
